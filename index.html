           <li> <b>820</b> - Al-Khwarizmi writes his most famous work, "Kitab al-Jabr wa-l-Muqabala" (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing), which introduces systematic solutions of linear and quadratic equations. This work laid the foundations of algebra and gave the subject its name.</li>
           <li> <b>830</b> - Al-Khwarizmi writes "Al-Kitab al-Mukhtasar fi Hisab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala" (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing), which is an introductory book on algebra and arithmetic. This work introduced the Hindu-Arabic numeral system to the Islamic world, which later spread to Europe and became the basis of modern arithmetic.</li>
           <li> <b>830-850</b> - Al-Khwarizmi serves as the head of the House of Wisdom (Bayt al-Hikma) in Baghdad, a major intellectual center during the Islamic Golden Age. </li>
